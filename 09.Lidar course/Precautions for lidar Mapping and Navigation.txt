Before performing the mapping and navigation operation, be sure to turn off the power of the car and ensure that it is placed stably on the ground.
Then, turn on the car and keep it stationary for 5 seconds so that the gyroscope can complete the initialization process.
If this step is not performed, the gyroscope may have abnormal conditions, which are as follows:
During mapping and navigation, the car body does not move, but the 3D model in rviz may rotate in place or deviate in a certain direction.
