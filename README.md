![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/MicroROS-Self-balancing-Robot/blob/main/MicroROS-Self-balancing-Robot.jpg)
# Introduction
Yahboom MicroROS self-balancing robot car is equipped with a metal chassis kit, 520 motor with encoder, 6-axis IMU attitude sensor, STM32 control board, ESP32 communication board, ultrasonic module, lidar and other accessories. It can not only maintain balanced movement on different terrains, but also support 4KG load. Compared with the traditional STM32/AR self-balancing car, this MicroROS self-balancing car adopt MicroROS wireless communication technology to transmit all sensor datas to the virtual machine system, completes complex computing tasks and generates decisions. Yahboom also provides mobile remote control APP and mapping navigation APP, allowing users to easily remotely control the car, while intuitively viewing the real-time mapping and navigation process, improving the user experience and development efficiency. ROS-WiFi camera module is optional, users can expand some AI visual interaction functions.
# Features
* MicroROS wireless communication technology + ROS2-HUMBLE system

1) Through MicroROS wireless communication, lidar, 6-axis sensor, camera and other datas are transmitted to the virtual machine in real time to complete complex calculations.

2) Supports RVIZ simulation, which can intuitively view the system status and operation process during the robot car mapping and navigation.

* Multiple functions

1) Supports SLAM mapping navigation, lidar/ultrasonic obstacle avoidance and following, display data on OLED.

2) If you choose the visual version, can also realize a series of AI visual interaction functions, such as QR code recognition, gesture control, face tracking, human posture recognition, etc.

3) Supports multi-vehicle synchronous navigation, multi-vehicle synchronous control.

4) Supports mobile phone APP control, keyboard online control, and handle control (Optional).

* High-performance hardware configuration

1) Metal chassis, 6-axis IMU sensor, high-power 520 motor, can support 4KG load, and easily cope with complex terrain and climbing challenges.

2) STM32 control board, which can efficiently drive the motor and support the connection of multiple peripherals.

3) ESP32 communication board, realizes MicroROS wireless communication with the virtual machine system.

* Development tutorials

Yahboom not only provides basic development materials for self-balancing robot car-related algorithms, but also provides ROS-related learning courses. Thatâ€™s suitable for educators, researchers and robotics enthusiasts learn and practice.
